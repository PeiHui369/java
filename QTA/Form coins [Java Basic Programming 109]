109. Write a Java program to form a staircase shape of n coins where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
> Ques Ask: How get ("Number of rows: "+((int)((Math.sqrt(8 * (long)n + 1) - 1) / 2)));	

Example 1:
n = 3
The coins can form the following rows:
$
$ $
We will return 2 rows.
Example 2:
n = 4
The coins can form the following rows:
$
$ $
$
We will return 2 rows as the 3rd row is incomplete.
Example 3:
n = 5
The coins can form the following rows:
$
$ $
$ $
We will return 2 rows as the 3rd row is incomplete.

<SAMPLE SOLUTION>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Example109 {
     public static void main(String[] arg) {
	  Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);	
       System.out.print("Input a positive integer: ");
        int n = in.nextInt(); 
		if (n>0)
		{
           System.out.println("Number of rows: "+((int)((Math.sqrt(8 * (long)n + 1) - 1) / 2)));	#
		}       	
	}	
}
