18. Write a Java method that accept three integers and check whether they are consecutive are not. Return true or false. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

Input the first number:  15
Input the second number:  16
Input the third number:  17
Check whether the three said numbers are consecutive or not!true

/*
From Wikipedia-
Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order. They have a difference of 1 between every two numbers. 
In a set of consecutive numbers, the mean and the median are equal.
If n is a number, then the next numbers will be n+1 and n+2.

Write a Java method that accept three integers and check whether they are consecutive are not. Return true or false.

Examples:
Consecutive numbers that follow each other in order:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
-3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
