7. Write a Java program to takes the user for a distance (in meters) and the time was taken (as three numbers: hours, minutes, seconds), and display the speed, in meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour (hint: 1 mile = 1609 meters)

import java.util.Scanner;
public class w3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
        System.out.print("Input distance in meters: ");
        int distance = keyboard.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Input hour: ");
        int hour = keyboard.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Input minutes: ");
        int minute = keyboard.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Input seconds: ");
        int seconds = keyboard.nextInt();
        keyboard.close();

        int totalSec = (hour*60*60)+(minute*60)+seconds;
        double hr = hour + (seconds/60/60) + (minute/60);
        double km = distance/1000;
        double miles = km*0.621371;
        double mS = (double)distance/totalSec;
        double kH = km/hr;
        double mH = miles/hr;
        System.out.printf("Your speed in meters/second is %.8f \n", mS);
        System.out.println("Your speed in km/h is "+ kH);
        System.out.println("Your speed in miles/h is "+ mH);
    }
}

Input distance in meters: 2500
Input hour: 5
Input minutes: 56
Input seconds: 23
Your speed in meters/second is 0.11691531 
Your speed in km/h is 0.4
Your speed in miles/h is 0.2485484
