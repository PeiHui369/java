27. Write a Java program to add a dash before and after every vowel in a given string.

public class test { 
   public static void main(String[] args) {	   
	    String text = "C++";
		System.out.println("Original string: "+text);
		System.out.println("Add a dash before and after every vowel in the said string: "+validate(text));
		text = "Java";
		System.out.println("\nOriginal string: "+text);
		System.out.println("Add a dash before and after every vowel in the said string: "+validate(text));
		text = "MID-CENTRALIZED";
		System.out.println("\nOriginal string: "+text);
		System.out.println("Add a dash before and after every vowel in the said string: "+validate(text));
		text = "LOWERED";
		System.out.println("\nOriginal string: "+text);
		System.out.println("Add a dash before and after every vowel in the said string: "+validate(text));
        }

   public static String validate(String text) {
	   return text.replaceAll("([AEIOUaeiou])","-$1-");
   }
}
