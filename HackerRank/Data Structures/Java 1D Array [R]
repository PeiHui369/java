- a simple data structure used to store a collection of data in a contiguous block of memory
- Each element in the collection is accessed using an index, and the elements are easy to find because they're stored sequentially in memory.
- Use when know exactly going to have how many pieces of data 

- To initialize:
int[] arrName = new int[4]; //store 4 integers, index from 0 to (size - 1)
- To store:
arrName[3] = 12;

=====
The code in your editor does the following:
1. Reads an integer from stdin and saves it to a variable, n, denoting some number of integers.
2. Reads n integers corresponding to a0, a1, ..., a(n-1) from stdin and saves each integer a(i) to a variable, val.
3. Attempts to print each element of an array of integers named a.

	//Start to generate & store

        }

        scan.close();

        // Prints each sequential element in array a
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
