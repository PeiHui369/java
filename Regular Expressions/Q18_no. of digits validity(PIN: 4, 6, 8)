(PIN): A personal identification number, or PIN, is a string of at least four digits used to unlock a bank account or card to which it has been assigned.

18. Write a Java program to validate a personal identification number (PIN). Assume the length of a PIN number is 4, 6 or 8. 

public class test {
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {	   
	    String n = "123";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));
	    n = "1234";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));
	    n = "12345";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));	
	    n = "123456";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));
	    n = "1234567";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));	    
		n = "12345678";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));
		n = "123456789";
		System.out.println("Original PIN Number: "+n);
		System.out.println("Is the said PIN number is valid? "+validate(n));		
        }

   public static boolean validate(String n) {
	   return n.matches("\\d{4}|\\d{6}|\\d{8}");
   }
}
