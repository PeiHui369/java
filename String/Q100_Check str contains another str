100. Write a Java program to check if a given string contains another string. Return true or false. Go to the editor

Sample Output:

Original string:

With more than 9 million developers worldwide, Java enables you to efficiently develop, deploy and use exciting applications and services.

Is 'million' present in the said text?
true

Is 'millions' present in the said text?
false
