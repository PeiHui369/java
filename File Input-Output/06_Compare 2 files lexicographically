Write a Java program to compare two files lexicographically.

According to Wikipedia:
In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order 
(also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographic(al) product) 
is a generalization of the way the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. 
This generalization consists primarily in defining a total order over the sequences 
(often called words in computer science) of elements of a finite totally ordered set, often called alphabet.

import java.io.File;
public class Exercise6 {
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
       String str1 = "Java exercises";
       String str2 = "Java exercises";
       String str3 = "Java examples";

       int var1 = str1.compareTo( str2 );
       System.out.println("str1 & str2 comparison: "+var1);

       int var2 = str1.compareTo( str3 );
       System.out.println("str1 & str3 comparison: "+var2);

    }
}
