49. Write a Java program to find first non-repeating character from a stream of characters.

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) 
{  
  
int MXCHAR = 256;
 
  List < Character > inDLL = new ArrayList < Character > ();
  boolean[] repeatyn = new boolean[MXCHAR];
  String chrstream = "godisgood";
  System.out.println("String: " + chrstream);
  for (int i = 0; i < chrstream.length(); i++) {
   char x = chrstream.charAt(i);
   System.out.println("Reading: " + x);
   
   if (!repeatyn[x]) { //default value will always be false
    
    if (!(inDLL.contains(x))) { //if not contains in list, will be added
     inDLL.add(x);
    } else {
     inDLL.remove((Character) x); //if contains in list, will be removed
     repeatyn[x] = true; //now the boolean true again, repeated value has been removed
    }
   }
   
   if (inDLL.size() != 0) { //if the list size not zero, contain value
    System.out.print("The first non-repeating character so far is:  "); 
    System.out.println(inDLL.get(0)); //print out the first value in list
   }
  }
 }

}
