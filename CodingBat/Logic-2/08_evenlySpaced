Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large.


evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) → false

===================================
equals space between integer

public boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c) {
  int[] arr = {a,b,c};    //store in array
  Arrays.sort(arr);       //sort to arrange in ascending order
  
  return ((arr[1] - arr[0]) == (arr[2] - arr[1]));
}
