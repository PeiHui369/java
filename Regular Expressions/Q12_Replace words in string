12. Write a Java program to replace Python with Java and code with coding in a given string

import java.util.*;
public class test {
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
	   
	    String text = "Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. " + 
		"Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. " +
		"Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write" +
		"clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.";
		System.out.println("Original string:");
		System.out.println(text);
		System.out.println("\nAfter replacing Python to Java and code to coding in the said string:");
		System.out.println(validate(text));
        }

   public static String validate(String text) {
	   return text.replace("Python", "Java").replace("code", "coding");
   }
}

Original string:
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers writeclear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

After replacing Python to Java and code to coding in the said string:
Java is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes coding readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers writeclear, logical coding for small and large-scale projects.
